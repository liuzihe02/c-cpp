# File I/O Functions

- fstream - A combination of ofstream and ifstream: creates, reads, and writes to files
- ofstream  - creates and writes to files
- ifstream  - reads from files

We must include `<fstream>` to use files in a program.

## Opening Files

Two ways to open files:
- Using constructor
- Using member function `open()` of the class

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{   
    //ofstream means it can only be used to write into the opened file
    //if this file doesnt exist, it will be autocreated
    ofstream outObject("example.txt");
    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    //ifstream means can only read from this file
    ifstream inObject("example.txt"); 
    return 0;
}
```

## Closing Files

Good practice to close open files after youre done using them.

```cpp
file_objectname.close();
```

## Writing to Files

```cpp
string str = "Welcome_To_CodeWithHarry!";
ofstream out("example.txt");
out << str;
```

## Reading files

```cpp
string str;
ifstream in("example.txt");
in >> str;
cout << str;
```
