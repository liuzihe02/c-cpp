# Pointers

## Variables and Memory

When you refer to a variable, the compiler takes 2 steps

1. Get the address that the variable name corresponds to
2. Go to that memory address and retrieves the value

C++ allows us to perform these steps independently:
1. `&x` evaluates to the address of `x`
2. `*(&x)` allows us to take the address of `x` and *dereference* it by retrieving the value at that address

## Why Pointers?

Pointers are memory addresses, and manipulating the memory addresses is much more efficient than manipulating the data itself.
- Pass-by-reference
  - Pass the memory address of the object into functions rather than the object itself, reduce memory usage
  - Manipulate complex data structures effectively
  - Use polymorphism: calling functions on data without knowing data type
  - Used to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory

## What are Pointers?

Pointers are just variables storing integers, and these integers happen to be memory addresses of other variables like `x`. We access the value of `x` by dereferencing the pointer.

The pointer `ptr` stores the integer `12310`.

## Pointer Usage

**Declaration:**

```cpp
float *ptr = &x;
```
This points to the float variable `x`.

We can also have pointers to variables of any type:

```cpp
data_type *pointer_name = address
```

**Usage**

We *dereference a pointer* with `*` to access its value:
```cpp
cout<<*ptr // prints the value pointed to by the ptr, which would be the value of x
```

This is how we pass by reference in functions!

We can also use the pointer to modify the values of `x`:
```cpp
*ptr=5 //sets the value of x
```

Without the `*` operator, `ptr` just gives the memory address:
```cpp
cout << ptr; //outputs the memory address of x in base 16
```

## References

```cpp
float y;
float &x = y; //makes x a reference, or alias, of y
```

After these declarations, changing `x` will change `y` as they refer to the same object. References are just pointers that are dereferenced every time they are used. The only difference is:
- references are auto-deferenced, no need to do this explicitly
- cannot change the location of where a reference points, whereas you can do this for pointers
- when writing the value you want to make a reference to, you do not put an `&` for references but you need to do so for pointers

## Confusion between `*` and `&`

Use of `*`:
- When declaring a pointer, `*` is placed before the variable name and after the type name to indicate this is a pointer pointing to a variable of that type
  - commonly done in function parameters


```cpp
// Declaration: * indicates a pointer type
int* ptr;
```

```cpp
void swap(int *x, int *y)
```

> note `int *ptr;` is equivalent and just a matter of style

- When using a pointer that has already been set to some value, `*` is used to dereference it:
```cpp
// Function parameters
void foo(int* p) {
    *p = 20;  // Dereference to modify the pointed-to value
}
```

Use of `&`:
- to indicate a reference data type
  - commonly done in function parameters
```cpp
// Declaration: & indicates a reference type
int x = 5;
int& ref = x;  // ref is a reference to x,
```

```cpp
void swapValues(int &x, int &y)
```

> note that `int& ref` and `int &ref` are equivalent; only a matter of coding style
- take the address of a variable:
```cpp
// Usage: & takes the address of a variable
int* ptr = &x;  // ptr now holds the address of x
```


## Pointers to Pointers

In pointer to pointer, we store the address of one pointer to another pointer. This is also known as multiple indirections owing to the operatorâ€™s name.  Here, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the address where the actual variable has its value stored.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a = 100;
    int *b = &a;
    int **c = &b;
    cout << "Value of variable a is " << a << endl;
    cout << "Address of variable a is " << b << endl;
    cout << "Address of pointer b is " << c << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Arrays and Pointers

The *name* of an array *decays to* a pointer to the *first element* of an array, in most contexts. We can do this because all the elements are contiguous. So `arr` is actually the integer address of the first element. However, note that the elements of the array are still values themselves.

```cpp
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```

- `arr` is the address of the first element (it decays to a pointer to the first element)
- `arr[0]`, `arr[1]` are the actual integer values like `10`,`20` etc
- `&arr[0]`,`&arr[1]` gives you the addresses of these elements

We make use of the fact that C-style arrays are contiguous. This means we can do pointer arithmetic like `arr+1` which returns the address of the second element, and the subarray.

```cpp
int marks[] = {99, 100, 38};
int *p = marks;
cout << "The value of marks[0] is " << *p << endl;
cout << "The value of marks[1] is " << *(p + 1) << endl;
cout << "The value of marks[2] is " << *(p + 2) << endl;
```

will print
```
The value of marks[0] is 99
The value of marks[1] is 100
The value of marks[2] is 38
```

Note that `p`,`q`, and `arr` are basically equivalent here:
```cpp
//p here is a pointer to the array, same as pointer to the first elem in the array
int *p = arr ;
// we have to use & to get the address of the first element, arr[0] will return the value
int *q = &arr[0];
```

### Arrays, Pointers, Strings

We can create an array of strings, where is element is actually a pointer to a character which is the first element of the string
  - allows array to store multiple strings of different lengths efficiently, as each elem is only a pointer to the beginning of the string
  - we can do this because C-style strings have characters in contiguous memory!

<img src="images/image-1.png" width=600>

```cpp
const char *suitNames[] = {"Clubs", "Diamonds", "Spades", "Clubs"};
cout << "Enter a suit number (1-4): ";
unsigned int suitNum;
cin >> suitNum;
if(suitNum <= 3)
    cout << suitNames[suitNum - 1];
```
> here, we cannot declare `const char suitNames[]` without `*` as this means storing an array of characters, which is not valid here

We commonly use this in the `main` function:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { body }
```
- `argc` is a nonnegative value representing the number of arguments passed into program (including function name)
- `argv` is a pointer to an array containing `argc+1` elements - each elem in this array is a pointer to the first character of that argument string. The last element is the null pointer.


## Returning Pointers

When you declare a local variable within a function, that variable goes out of scope when the function exits: the memory allocated to it is reclaimed by the operating system, and anything that was stored in that memory may be cleared. Therefore returning a pointer to a local variable declared within the function usually generates a runtime error.

```cpp
// this function returns a pointer
int *getRandNumPtr() {
    int x = rand();  // 'x' is a local variable, it exists only within this function
    return &x;       // DANGER: Returning address of local variable
                     // 'x' will be destroyed when the function exits
}

int main() {
    // This call receives a pointer to memory that is no longer valid
    int *randNumPtr = getRandNumPtr();

    // UNSAFE: Attempting to access memory that may have been reallocated
    // This could crash the program or print unexpected values
    cout << *randNumPtr; // ERROR: Dereferencing an invalid pointer

    return 0;  // Program ends, but behavior is undefined due to invalid memory access
}
```
